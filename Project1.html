	<h2>
		Cayman Island
	</h2>
	<p>
		I went to Cayman Islands for a vacation in 2017, with my significant other. We had an amazing and beautiful beach front view, a corner room to be percise. We relaxed at the beach bar and enjoyed some good food. We took some digital photos of the goregous views in various places of the resort such as the pier, the hammocks and a few from the beach chairs. Later, that evening we sat on the beach for dinner, watched the amazing sunset and took a dip in the warm, calming wave of waters.

	<p>
		The next day and over the next couple of days, that we were there for, we did so much and did so many activities. We woke up early, took some early morning digital photos and watched the most amazing sunrise together. Later, we went to a diving and snorkeling palce called, Oceans Frontier. We went on a boat with a few other people and went snorkeling for the first time. We saw so many fish, we saw a ship wreck and string rays. As the day was passing by and we were having a blast, we both ended up getting sunburned, but it was totally worth it.
		The next day, we did some snorkeling at our resort and also went jetskiing for the first time. As we both went out into the water with our jetskiis, it was pretty amazing to see how the water was so clear, blue and goregous to be gliding across the water. Our last adventure on the last day, we went to an area called String Ray City. As we got there, we were on the boat on our way to the sting ray area. We were both so excited and as we got there, we were in the water, waist deep and swimming with the sting rays. We let them swim around us, we gave it food and felt how it sucked the food from our hands, which was really neat.

		As this vacation had come to an end, I can garentee that we did so much fun and we did so many activities and truly enjoyed this vacation as a couple. Cayman Islands was truly a vacationing experience for anyone and for however long one truly needs to have an amazing vacation here.

		Hiking
	</h2>
	<p>
		I love going on hikes. It always feels like an adventure when I go hiking for the first or hundredth time. The reason I go on hikes is to see the world in different perspectives. I like going on hikes to clear my mind, smell the fresh air, hear the birds chirp their bird songs and seek adventures to what the world lies in front of me.
	</p>
	<p>
		When I go hiking, I like to go to new places to find new meaning about myself and about the world. I have gone hiking at many places. Here are some places that I have been to, to discover. I have been to West Rock Ridge Park, as well as East Rock Ridge Park in New Haven. These two large mountainness parks have the most spectacular views, once I have made it to the top. The wooded trails of West Rock Ridge, that I took on my way up, were near the edge of the mountain with the view of downtown New Haven and the view of Long Island Sound. There is also a whole side of the Mounatin Park that I haven't yet discovered.

	<p>
		The other large mountain, that I hiked up on, East Rock Ridge, was not just as amazing as the West Rock Ridge, but it had a different perspective of view. Even though it wasn't as tall or as large as the other park, but it had it's uniqueness to it. It had a paved path to the top, even though I took the roaded path, which had a different view fromt eh edge of the West Rock Ridge. As I made it through the top, there were more trees and openness to it. As I look out to the horizon, with the most goregous sunset, I see a different perspective of downtown New Haven and the view of Long Island Sound. Seeing this side of the city from a differnt mountain, compared to West Rock Ridge, allowed me to see that life will always look different, no matter what angle you look at it.

		New Places I Wish To Go, To Go Skiiing 
	</h2>
	<p>
		I have skiied almost all my life, whenever it snows more than 5 inches, if any, during the winter season. I have skiied at many good mountains for most of my life, but I would love to experience skiing at other mountains across the country and maybe also across the world. Skiing allows me the freedom to take in the mountain views and take my time going down. Each mountain I have gone down while skiing, has always been breathtaking, not matter if I've gone down the mountain the first time or the tenth time. It always looks different with every visit of each year or 3.
	</p>
	<p>
		Exploring new ski mountains would be exhilerating and exubarating at the same time. Riding a new moutain would be a new challenge, a new exploration and a new experience for me all at once. Sometimes, the best part about skiing and being up at the top of that mountain, is seeing the sunsets when I get the chance to stay a bit later. I would love to go to a mountain and be able to see the top of the clouds, just like in and above the clouds and seeing the most breath taking view of the surrounding mountains.
